# Progress Log

## Session 3 (macos) — 2026-09-05 — Explicit roots in shared workspaces

**Agent**: Codex.
**Owner decision**: D20 confirms multiple project/worktree roots in one workspace, with every
terminal, editor, agent and game session explicitly bound to its own root. This answers session
2's pending question; it is not blanket approval of the feature inventory.

**Summary**: Updated the charter, orchestrator specification, architecture, roadmap and agent
instructions. The proposed implementation separates stable root identity, repository identity,
launch directory and shell cwd. Focus changes and tab moves cannot retarget existing operations.
Root removal/missing directories retain visible session associations instead of guessing a new
checkout. Root binding records context; it is not an access sandbox.

**Proposal changes**: Tightened 11 existing features around two worktrees, duplicate filenames,
similarly named sessions and preserved root bindings after GUI restart. No feature IDs,
dependencies or completion states changed. All 54 remain proposed/non-passing; `features.json`
is still absent. The first desktop milestone retains its actual game tab and session browser.

**Verification**: `./init.sh` passes. Graph reproduction, local document links, proposal state and
desktop/library dependency boundaries are checked before commit. No runtime code, sibling
workspace, game build, installation, device or training job was changed or executed.

**Questions pending**: Select the first live game (NOLF recommended, followed by the VtMB adapter)
and editor recovery policy (local recovery drafts with explicit saves recommended). These were
asked together; do not treat either recommendation as confirmed before an answer.

**Next suggested task**: Record the answers and refine F32's concrete desktop acceptance spec.
Present the proposed scope for review before activating implementation. Toolkit feasibility,
Vim subset and measured budgets remain open; settled platform/lifecycle/multi-root choices do not.

## Session 2 (macos) — 2026-09-05 — Library base and desktop orchestrator design

**Agent**: Codex.
**Owner decisions**: Charter D07–D19 records the library-base thesis; curated upstream plus our
own gaps; one library proven in both games first; tab/split IDE; terminal-based Bash agent
selection/installation/MCP bootstrap; macOS and Windows from the start; adapters first with
external-app research; Quest 2D workspace with desktop sidecar before spatial panes; tree,
previews and basic editing with optional Vim; retained sessions with explicit Stop and a session
browser; and desktop workspace/terminals/flat-game-tab as the first implementation milestone.

**Summary**: Revised the initial shared-runner-first plan. Added the library quality proposal,
orchestrator spec and primary-source investigations of Meta XR Operator, Quest delivery and
external app presentation. The first desktop proof includes actual game pixels/input and session
reattachment on both platforms. iklib remains the recommended named library and flat NOLF the
recommended first game; neither name is treated as an explicit new owner decision.

**Proposal changes**: 54 features, all proposed/non-passing. Library and desktop branches are
independent. F32 is the first proposed local design/feasibility entry; desktop v0 closes at F48,
including the host-owned F43 game adapter and F54 session browser. Later agents, XR, Quest and
external-app work have separate gates. The previous blanket editor deferral is superseded.
No accepted feature history was rewritten and `features.json` remains absent pending review.

**Research findings**: Official Meta documentation establishes native standalone Operator and
Android/PWA/Spatial SDK routes suitable for a Quest-client feasibility path. Windows supports
window parenting with caveats and window capture; Apple documents window/app capture. These
support candidate designs, not universal embedding, tested native-host compatibility or store
approval. The proposed sidecar owns files/builds/PTYs/agents/game sessions; layout/session
contracts can serve desktop and Quest views. MCP inspection/control is separate from live-pane
presentation. Source links and proof requirements are recorded in `docs/research/`.

**Verification**: `./init.sh` validates 54 features and their dependency graph. Before commit,
check graph reproducibility, local Markdown links, all-proposed status, desktop-v0 dependency
closure and independence from the library/training/installer branches. No runtime code changed;
no game, native build, GUI prototype, install, device or training job was executed. No reference
workspace was modified.

**Question pending**: Whether one workspace contains multiple project/worktree roots with each
session explicitly bound to a root (recommended), or one root per workspace. Prior strategy,
platform, editing, lifecycle and first-milestone questions have been answered; do not repeat them.

**Next suggested task**: Record the project-association answer, settle the bounded desktop v0
spec, and present the revised feature proposal for owner review. Qualify the implementation stack
through real terminal/editor/game-surface feasibility on both desktops before building the larger
UI. Preserve the required game tab and session browser in the first useful milestone. Agent
recipes/Windows Bash details and later Quest/XR scope remain follow-up design decisions.

## Session 1 (macos) — 2026-09-05 — Initial harness and architecture interview

**Agent**: Codex initializer.
**Summary**: Created rEngine's local harness and a concrete proposed roadmap from read-only
inspection of reLith, reSource, iklib, training, and the newly discovered infra-vr dependency.
The charter distinguishes owner-established requirements, code-derived facts, and recommendations.
The interview is ongoing; no answer to the first question round had arrived at this checkpoint.

**Artifacts**: `AGENTS.md`, thin `CLAUDE.md` entry point, this shared log, `init.sh`, local feature
query/validation helper, charter and harness specs, architecture, source hashes, reconnaissance,
integration plan, 30-feature proposal, generated roadmap graph, and known-issues inventory.

**Features completed**: None. This is harness setup, not implementation of the proposed shared
runner, schemas, engine integrations, packaging recipes, or training bridge. `features.json` is
intentionally absent until the concrete proposal is reviewed. The helper labels proposal queries
and offers no executable feature before that review.

**Verification**: Bootstrap succeeds and is independent of sibling paths and native game
toolchains. Inventory types, dependencies and cycles validate. Focused CLI checks exercise
duplicate/unknown IDs, cycles, malformed JSON, review/evidence requirements, local readiness,
host handoffs, graph reproducibility and invocation outside the repository. The first document
link check caught this progress file before it had been written; it is included in final checks.
Final command results are recorded in `docs/evidence/initial-harness.md`.

**Known issues**: First milestone, “both streams,” minimum powered-by contract, infra-vr role,
platform/resource scope and catalog policy remain interview questions. Source worktrees were
active; use the recorded per-file hashes and recheck before future integration. No reference
repo was edited and no game/build/device/service/training workload was run. iklib host migrations
remain owned by their original workspaces and tracker.

**Next suggested task**: Continue the first interview round, record answers in
`docs/specs/000-charter.md`, then ask the dependent workflow/curation questions. Refine and present
the concrete feature proposal for owner review. After acceptance, create `features.json` with
`review_status: approved` and a `review_record` reference, retire the proposal as the active
source, regenerate the graph, and choose the approved first slice. Do not restart reconnaissance
unless facts needed for that slice have changed.
